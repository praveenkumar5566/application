V Cube Software: token called sonar token server.

159
00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:44.530
V Cube Software: How can save it?

160
00:19:48.090 --> 00:19:52.300
V Cube Software: So now come to print shop

161
00:19:53.260 --> 00:19:55.239
V Cube Software: so, and then configure it.

162
00:20:01.340 --> 00:20:06.009
V Cube Software: So once Mavent, test is done, you need to do the port quality analysis. Yes.

163
00:20:07.340 --> 00:20:13.560
V Cube Software: and then vaulting. It is past or not. The! If everything is good, then on it is halting, it is going to pass.

164
00:20:15.190 --> 00:20:16.939
V Cube Software: So open this.

165

00:20:22.730 --> 00:20:23.990
V Cube Software: my Venturist

167
00:20:32.830 --> 00:20:37.489
V Cube Software: sonar scanner equal to tool sonar scanner. Yes.

168
00:20:37.540 --> 00:20:41.940
V Cube Software: So why, we have used sonar scanner. I'm going to show you why we have used sonar scanner.

169
00:20:42.150 --> 00:20:45.299
V Cube Software: click on dashboard. Open new link. Come here.

170
00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:49.649

171
00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:54.469
V Cube Software: Are you able to see? So now.

172
00:20:55.610 --> 00:20:57.030
V Cube Software: scanner installation.

173
00:20:57.330 --> 00:21:01.879
V Cube Software: So, sonar Scanlan, what is the name of the sonar scanner. I have given sonar

174
00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:08.009
V Cube Software: scanner. That is the reason why we are going to sonar home to equal to sonar scanner.

175
00:21:09.830 --> 00:21:11.220
V Cube Software: And then next, but

176
00:21:11.470 --> 00:21:14.310
V Cube Software: stages sonar steps

177
00:21:14.340 --> 00:21:16.020
V Cube Software: with the sonar. Q

178
00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:23.350
V Cube Software: environment, sonar server. So in in a system, what we put sonar server, and what is the token?

179
00:21:23.530 --> 00:21:27.419
V Cube Software: The credential token we've generated on credential token. We have name it as a

180
00:21:28.490 --> 00:21:30.330
V Cube Software: come down. You name it as a

181
00:21:30.650 --> 00:21:34.560
V Cube Software: so, not token. So this is the reason why we are going to do this. Yes.

182
00:21:35.010 --> 00:21:35.980
V Cube Software: come up.

183
00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.540
V Cube Software: So first thing, copy this enrollment

184
00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:48.070
V Cube Software: and under tools section, add this environment. So copy this.

185
00:21:49.690 --> 00:21:51.249
V Cube Software: So where is tools

186
00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:53.930
V Cube Software: under tool section.

187
00:21:55.020 --> 00:21:56.360
V Cube Software: upland, save

188
00:22:01.530 --> 00:22:06.839
V Cube Software: click on pets up configure. Now come down

189
00:22:08.530 --> 00:22:14.319
V Cube Software: under enrollments. A to add the tool section.

190
00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:19.330
V Cube Software: So environment already, we have added, okay, then that's fine, fine, fine fine.

191
00:22:20.710 --> 00:22:32.690
V Cube Software: Then if they come down. So we are going to add this solar queue.  so worldwide, stage analysis. server. And then

192
00:22:33.370 --> 00:22:40.409
V Cube Software: the sonar dot Project name is pet shop. and we have using the Java. So Java dot binary and just come down

193
00:22:41.700 --> 00:22:42.690
V Cube Software: and then

194
00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:45.420
V Cube Software: project keys pet shop.

195
00:22:45.780 --> 00:22:47.670
V Cube Software: So let's little bit go up

196

V Cube Software: and

214
00:27:34.860 --> 00:27:35.690
V Cube Software: I'm going

215
00:27:53.830 --> 00:27:57.620
V Cube Software: so sonar cube is done. We can go and check if you want.

216
00:27:57.800 --> 00:27:59.329
V Cube Software: just click on project.

217
00:28:02.150 --> 00:28:03.560
V Cube Software: So how many books?

218
00:28:04.350 --> 00:28:09.060
V Cube Software: 66 works? But this is doing the port, I mean, the final

219
00:28:09.730 --> 00:28:10.580
V Cube Software: check.

220
00:28:11.310 --> 00:28:13.690
V Cube Software: which is one big

221
00:28:16.750 --> 00:28:18.040
V Cube Software: who read the fish

222
00:28:26.740 --> 00:28:28.060
V Cube Software: console output.

223
00:29:03.950 --> 00:29:07.330
V Cube Software: Only 2 steps are printing verbal and dependency checks.

224
00:29:16.650 --> 00:29:18.000
V Cube Software: Yes.

225
00:29:18.420 --> 00:29:24.750
V Cube Software: okay, cool quality.

226
00:29:33.540 --> 00:29:37.690
V Cube Software: We are going to skip this part configure randomly.

227
00:29:39.700 --> 00:29:41.170
V Cube Software: So that's Vimodi

228
00:29:42.380 --> 00:29:47.630
V Cube Software: calling it the waiting over there. Then I aborted that.

229
00:29:47.770 --> 00:29:48.950
V Cube Software: Just come down.

230
00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:58.910
V Cube Software: Yes, until 3, 1, 2, 3. So from here you need to woebek.

231
00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:02.450
V Cube Software: Okay, now, what you need to do is

232
00:30:03.130 --> 00:30:04.170
V Cube Software: come here.

233
00:30:06.630 --> 00:30:07.949
V Cube Software: Dependency check.

234
00:30:10.540 --> 00:30:16.899
V Cube Software: So maybe they build Mav and clean install and upon the the stage Maven package and external

235
00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:18.200
V Cube Software: page

236
00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:21.020
V Cube Software: package

237
00:30:28.520 --> 00:30:29.990

V Cube Software: copy this.

239
00:30:37.210 --> 00:30:39.379
V Cube Software: So you need to put

240
00:30:40.310 --> 00:30:44.780
V Cube Software: under stage only need to put the stage stage and then

241
00:30:46.470 --> 00:30:47.470
V Cube Software: paste it.

242
00:30:48.620 --> 00:30:49.410

V Cube Software: Okay? So now, what I'm going to do is

244
00:31:12.010 --> 00:31:13.160
V Cube Software: and we end

245
00:31:15.020 --> 00:31:19.890
V Cube Software: package, Ebu artifact generators and the artifact ranges and nothing.

246
00:31:19.900 --> 00:31:21.409
V Cube Software: It's going to do the dependence

247
00:31:34.010 --> 00:31:37.960
V Cube Software: click on pipeline syntax. Come here.

248
00:31:40.920 --> 00:31:48.030
V Cube Software: Are we able to see dependency? Ddd. Within Z. So dependency check

249
00:31:48.140 --> 00:31:53.239
V Cube Software: under this dependency check. What we need to check is under argument. Come here.

250
00:31:54.490 --> 00:31:57.750
V Cube Software: So hyphen, scan, format, excel.

251
00:31:57.830 --> 00:32:00.239
V Cube Software: and better dissolved iphone, scam.

252
00:32:00.530 --> 00:32:02.900

00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:22.330
V Cube Software: please.

257
00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:36.220
V Cube Software: So you can save the next one.

258
00:32:38.410 --> 00:32:41.019
V Cube Software: Publish dependency check results.

259
00:32:41.070 --> 00:32:45.729
V Cube Software: So in this, what is the format you want to mention. You can mention here. So my format is

260
00:32:46.660 --> 00:32:50.769
V Cube Software: dependency check report Xml, and then you can able to generate this.

261
00:32:51.380 --> 00:32:52.440
V Cube Software: Come back.

262
00:32:55.340 --> 00:32:56.999

V Cube Software: 52.

269
00:33:38.900 --> 00:33:40.219
V Cube Software: So let's go up

270
00:33:41.850 --> 00:33:47.999
V Cube Software: pipeline agent, any tools. So it is one close gate, 2 close open gate.

271
00:33:48.300 --> 00:33:52.680
V Cube Software: and 3 it is gonna be 4. It is gonna be 5, 6,

272
00:33:52.890 --> 00:33:54.430
V Cube Software: 7, 8,

273

V Cube Software: Now it is going to do the

282
00:34:33.780 --> 00:34:37.250
V Cube Software: web Bill Wirefel and on dependency check as well

283
00:34:41.690 --> 00:34:42.900
V Cube Software: cancel output.

284
00:34:48.420 --> 00:34:50.850
V Cube Software: It takes long, a little bit time.

285
00:35:26.360 --> 00:35:28.180
V Cube Software: but even the

286
00:35:29.250 --> 00:35:32.649
V Cube Software: which fits Polar Cubeface

287
00:35:53.420 --> 00:35:56.179
V Cube Software: so soon. If it is also done, it is going to build a

288
00:35:57.880 --> 00:35:59.909
V Cube Software: full stage. So here

289
00:36:02.170 --> 00:36:04.800
V Cube Software: where it is will stage.

290
00:36:06.580 --> 00:36:10.550
V Cube Software: Once we're done with, the build says we'll go to the dependency checkstage.

291
00:36:15.060 --> 00:36:16.570
V Cube Software: So Billy's success.

292
00:36:18.660 --> 00:36:21.250
V Cube Software: it is to the dependency check.

293
00:36:52.750 --> 00:36:56.060
V Cube Software: Okay, where can we get the dependency check

294
00:36:56.190 --> 00:36:57.350
V Cube Software: report acceptable.

295
00:36:57.440 --> 00:37:03.280
V Cube Software: So where leave workspace pet shop dependency check can be. So okay, copy this part.

296
00:37:04.380 --> 00:37:06.690
V Cube Software: No, until here. This is fine. Let's go

297
00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:12.790
V Cube Software: copy it. go here. And then CD,

298
00:37:16.500 --> 00:37:19.139
V Cube Software: unless so you're able to see the

299
